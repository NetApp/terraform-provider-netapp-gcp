# Note that the use of all of this file is not required - environment variables
# can still be completely set from the command line or your existing
# environment. In this case, don't use this file as it may cause conflicts.
#
# NOTE: Remove the annotations from any variables that have them inline, or
# else make will add the whitespace to the variable as well.

# The essentials. None of the tests will run if you don't have these.
